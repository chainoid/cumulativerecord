## Cumulative Record - Hyperledger Fabric Sample Application by Chainoid

This Cumulate Record demonstrates the workflow of test records in the studying process: operation between office staff, teachers and students.
In this exercise we will set up the minimum number of nodes required to develop chaincode. It has a single peer and a single organization.

#### Step1
- Add new group into the ledger
